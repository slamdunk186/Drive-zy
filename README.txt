Traffic, one of the greatest devils in urban cities. Every day people suffer
for hours in these traffic jams losing their valuable time. So, can’t we develop a
solution which will reduce the manpower and also the possibility of error and
also save the environment from getting polluted? So, we decided to address to
this problem of global traffic with the help of one of the most capable brains in
this world which is Artificial Intelligence (AI). This will not only help reduce the
wastage of time but will also contribute in reducing the carbon footprint of this
world. Also, along with solving the traffic our aim is to reduce the road accidents
and also to intimate the drivers about the blocks ahead in advance to reduce the
wastage of time. Also, in the upcoming phases of our project we plan to provide
special assistance to emergency services in which they receive priority even in
heavy traffic condition and to add an overtake assistance feature for light
vehicles over heavy vehicles.
So, now let’s look into the working of the project. First, the location of all
the vehicles shall be tracked accurately with the help of a positioning system
similar to GPS with the help of a satellite which we will be developing under the
Student Satellite Program which is a program run by the Indian Space Research
Organization (ISRO) which will also act as a communication relay between the
vehicles and the server which would be the home to the DRIVE-ZY AI model
and help in trans-ponding the data and instructions between them. Then after the
positions and other information are transmitted to the server, the server with the
help of AI would visualize the scenario and would virtually plot a graph of it on a
X-Y plane. Then the AI model would attempt many possible ways to solve the
problem in the virtual environment with the help of some algorithms and would
finally provide the most ideal solution which takes the least time and would then
transmit the instructions to the vehicles via satellite.
Hence in this world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and with such
advancements in technology, why is transport to be left behind? So, let’s make
commuting and travelling easy and prepare ourselves for the future. Also let’s
contribute in reducing the carbon emissions in this globe for a healthy and fresh
environment. This system will revolutionize the automobile and transport
industry and make it smart with the touch of AI in it. Therefore, we conclude that
our project DRIVE-ZY will provide a unique, user-friendly, economical, reliable,
quick and safe solutions to this problem of urban traffic.
